# IndividualProjectGameV2
This is the second iteration of the individual project game, a 2D side-scrolling platformer. The purpose of the individual project game is to create a spelling game aimed at KS1 students (5 to 7 years old). The idea is to have a third person character move to different areas on the map. Upon stumbling on a button pad, the camera would shift to a spelling board where the character could spell out the word.
